# Samsung SSP - Guidance

## Native Portrait

The great benefit of the new Native Portrait feature is that you no longer need to rotate videos and can simply use the on-screen Samsung Menu to set the portrait mode and the Signagelive application will adhere to this setting.

Please Note:  It is not possible to achieve this functionality if you have an earlier panel model such as the C or D range.

To Configure Native Portrait on your Tizen players: 

press the Red A on your remote
change the Rotation to be either 90 or 270 degrees and ensure the Rotate Videos tick box is selected.
Save your settings
Now all your landscape content will automatically rotate to appear in a portrait orientation.

Please Note: With your Tizen you can also use our Portrait App to display your content by entering the following into the URL launcher on your display http://clients.signagelive.com/samsungsoc/latest/v4/portrait

To Configure Native Portrait on your E range players, you must follow the steps below: 
The first step is that you will need to change the URL you are using in the URL Launcher from https://go.smartlfd.com/v2 to http://go.smartlfd.com/v2/portrait via the Home button and then the Change URL option. 
Please note: Following this step, you must deactivate and reactivate your Signagelive player before the settings will take place. 
When you have changed the URL, please now click the Source button and select any of the inputs. As they appear first we'd recommend selecting the PC or HDMI inputs, but it does not matter which you choose for the process.
Once the source has changed, please now click on the Menu button and then from the options select the OnScreen Display option. From the sub-options that will appear from doing this, please select Display Orientation.
On the Display Orientation window, please now ensure that the OnScreen Menu Orientation and Source Content Orientation are set to be Portrait.
Once you have made these selections, you are now ready to press the Home button and then select URL Launcher to return back to using the Samsung Smart Signage application with Signagelive.
You have now successfully changed the screen orientation, which will act now as your native setting as opposed to using the Signagelive application to achieve this.

## Video

### Seamless Video Transitions

It is strongly recommended that you use videos encoded with the same resolution and FPS for seamless video transitions. This is a recommendation directly from Samsung.

### Gapless Playback for Fullscreen Video content

How do I set Gapless Playback?
If you're using one of the newer Samsung models (D range and higher) we have now developed our Signagelive solution to allow gapless playback when using fullscreen videos only. Working with this understanding you can then remove the black frames and achieve gapless playback. 

Please Note: Gapless playback  with Signagelive on the Samsung Smart Signage Platform is achievable on the D range panels and later. If you have a C range panel then gapless cannot be achieved. Moreover, the playlist published will need to have video only. 
 
What do I need to do to my Playlist to make it Gapless?
To make your content completely gapless, your Playlist should only include video of the same format (we recommend MP4) and ideally encoded using the same details as well (read more about that, here).

Gapless Playback Tip: If you have followed the instructions and still find that your Playlist is showing black frames between the videos then we recommend you check whether there are black elements at the beginning and end of your videos. If this is the case then this will be causing the playback to show these black elements and will result in playback not appearing to be gapless.
