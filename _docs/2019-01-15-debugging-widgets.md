# Debugging Widgets on Media Players

To assist in the development and troubleshooting of Signagelive widgets we have compiled the following media player specific guides. These guides will outline how to troubleshoot on a specific Digital Signage device and what additional requirements may be required to do so.

The following guides are available:

<a href="/debugging-lg/">LG</a>

<a href="/debugging-chrome/">ChromeOS</a>

<a href="/debugging-electron/">Electron Client (Windows/Mac)</a>

<a href="/debugging-brightsign/">Brightsign</a>

<a href="/debugging-iadea/">IAdea</a>

Also as part of this development process there is the ability to debug widgets locally on the userâ€™s PC, therefore the following guide has been made available regarding debugging within a browser:

<a href="/debugging-browser/">Chrome/Firefox Browser</a>

# Additional Guidance

Further information has been compiled and provided below that covers specific usecases and recommendations when developing Widgets for usage in Signagelive. For example, video rendering/playback and concurrent video tag limitations.
